    <h2>About</h2>
    <p><em><strong>"ON MY WAY AGAIN"</strong><em> is an ode to my very nomadic lifestyle. This is my very own scapbook in digital form. After losing my second hard drive in two years, I realized how important it is for me to share my photos, stories and footage while I can. One of my greatest loves is without a doubt <strong>Playa Del Carmen</strong>, and I wanted to share her with you. This is the beginning of my next adventure, where you'll find me chasing food, dancing under the moonlight and floating in the brightest blue waters. Here's a little glimpse into my world.</p>

  <p><em><strong>On My Way Again</strong><em> is more than a song, it's a way of life. It's about chasing the kind of high that feeds your soul, following a road not knowing where it goes, jumping in every single body of water your eyes can spot, and not limiting yourself by doing what you're supposed to do. Do what makes you the best version of yourself, and everything else will fall into place. The universe is on your side, you just have to be able to listen. </p>
